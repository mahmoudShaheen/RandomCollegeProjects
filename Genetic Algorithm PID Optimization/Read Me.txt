Variables you can edit :
	
	Genetic.m:
		Number of iterations (Generations)  >> M
		Population Size >> PopSize (Choose any even number)
		Kp, Ki, Kd limits by changing their values in the following
			Controller_Limits = [ 5, 3, 1];			%[Kp, Ki, Kd]
			
			
	fitness.m
		the process transfer function to be controlled by changing :
			R1, C1, R2 and C2 values
		
	For changing the cross_over method you need to rewrite the code as it is not generalized .
